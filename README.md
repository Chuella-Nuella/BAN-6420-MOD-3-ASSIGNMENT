Policy Management System 
This project is a comprehensive Python-based Policy Management System designed to help an insurance company manage its operations effectively. 
It provides tools for handling policyholders, insurance products, and payments. The system demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes,
methods, inheritance, and error handling.

Overview
The Policy Management System is built to streamline key functionalities of an insurance company. It allows administrators to:
•	Register and manage policyholders.
•	Create, update, and remove insurance products.
•	Process payments, send reminders, and apply penalties for overdue accounts.
By combining modular design with Python’s OOP principles, the system ensures scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.
Features
1.	Policyholder Management 
This feature handles all operations related to policyholders:
Registration: Add new policyholders to the system with basic details.
Account Suspension: Temporarily deactivate a policyholder's account, preventing transactions.
Reactivation: Reactivate suspended accounts when conditions are met.
Association with Products: Link policyholders to one or more insurance products.
        2. Product Management
This module provides functionality for managing insurance products:
Creation: Add new insurance products, specifying details such as name, description, and price.
Updating: Modify the information of existing products to reflect changes.
Suspension: Remove products from availability, ensuring they are no longer sold to customers.
          3. Payment Management
This feature manages the payment lifecycle of policyholders:
Processing Payments: Record and confirm payments made by policyholders.
Reminders: Notify policyholders of upcoming or overdue payments.
Penalties: Automatically apply penalties for late payments based on predefined rules.
Installation and Usage
Installation Steps:
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository:
Use this link to access the repository: GitHub Repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
Open the folder containing the downloaded files.
3. Ensure required files are present:
Confirm the following Python files are in the same directory:
policyholder.py
product.py
payment.py
main.py
Running the Program
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the main script by entering the following command:
python main.py
Expected Output:
The program will simulate the following scenarios:
Displaying a list of available products after creation.
Registering new policyholders and associating them with products.
Processing payments and displaying payment details.
Demonstrating error handling with meaningful error messages.

Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple Python modules to ensure modularity and clarity:
policy-management-system/  
├── policyholder.py   # Contains the Policyholder class and related methods.  
├── product.py        # Defines the Product class and product operations.  
├── payment.py        # Manages payments, reminders, and penalties.  
├── main.py           # The main script to run and demonstrate the system.  
└── README.md         # Documentation and setup instructions.
Each module has a specific purpose:
policyholder.py: Manages policyholder registration, suspension, and reactivation.
product.py: Handles the creation, updating, and suspension of products.
payment.py: Facilitates payment processing, reminder generation, and penalty applications.
main.py: Integrates all modules to demonstrate the system’s functionality.
Technical Highlights
Object-Oriented Design:  The system leverages OOP principles for a clean and efficient structure. Classes represent key entities like Policyholder, Product, and Payment, 
each encapsulating relevant attributes and methods.
Error Handling:  Robust error handling ensures smooth execution. Errors such as invalid input or failed transactions are caught and displayed as user-friendly messages.
Modularity:  Each functionality is implemented in a separate module, promoting reusability and easier debugging.
Use Cases
Insurance Companies:  Automate the management of policyholders, products, and payments.
Educational Purposes:  Serve as a learning tool for understanding Python OOP principles.
Business Automation:  Form the foundation for more complex insurance management systems.
This Policy Management System is a practical application of Python programming principles, designed to solve real-world problems in insurance operations while showcasing
the power of modular and object-oriented design.
